# ADE7763 Breakout

Minimal Breakout Board for Analog Devices [ADE7763](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADE7763.pdf) Enegry Monitor ASIC. This ASIC is a bit dated, but well supported and heavily used in commercial/off-the-shelf
energy metering devices.

## Where to get it

This breakout can be obtained fully assembled via [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/whatnick/ade7763-breakout/) or
as bare PCB for self assembly from [Oshpark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Y6oIkjGJ).

## Usage

This PCB is designed for breadboard usage and as such should never be connected to LV (240v/120v) power. Use a transformer +
voltage divider mechanism to sample the voltage and a current transformer + multiplier resistor mechanism to sample to current.
